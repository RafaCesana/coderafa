                                <p class="DefaultText">&emsp;This website is being developed by me, Rafael Cesana. I am a Software Developer, currently working at the North American company Southern Cross Aviation. I have been part of the IT team for over 3 years. I work on some projects such as the company's webstore and I follow from the beginning the entire change from the old ERP system to the new one that is still being developed by our team and will be implemented soon. </p>
                                </br>
                                <p class="DefaultText">&emsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;">A little bit about my tragetory:</span> Graduated in Chemistry from Presbiterian University Mackenzie, I worked with research within the college where I was part of 2 publications on nanomaterials studies in partnership with the University of São Paulo. My father is a senior programmer, and therefore, at that time I already had initial knowledge linked to computing, mainly tools such as PS and AI, as well as Html and CSS, by doing some work for him and earning extra income. As soon as I graduated from college, I ended up moving to the programming area where I started as a Trainee at SCA on the IT team. Later, I decided to start a degree in the area (Software Analysis and Development in University São Francisco). After settling in and going through some disciplines, I chose to abandon the course for the purpose of dedicating myself to building this website and delving into more specific knowledge of web development.

It is also an environment where I can freely test different technologies and explore them. So that it wouldn't just stay on my machine, I decided to put up and maintain the website so that it can also serve as a portfolio, in addition to being able to share some knowledge with other developers or those curious about the area.</p>

Good design practices were also taken from the book (UX Design definitive guide with the best UX practices by Will Grant).</p>

No code was copied and pasted into this website. Regardless of similarity, all code written on this website was understood and written by me. </p>
